# Blast-radius theorems: damage upper bounds under privileged-key compromise

This module implements the Tier-1 theorem list (T1-T4) of `docs/05-blast-radius.md`:
upper bounds on user-asset loss when a privileged role's key is fully compromised
(the social-engineering threat model, cf. Bybit 2025).

Threat model: the attacker holds the private key of one or more role addresses
(`pauseController`, `yieldDistributor`, `admin`, `oracle`, ...) and can submit an
arbitrary sequence of operations with those callers, interleaved with honest traffic.
A failed operation reverts (state unchanged), so a trace executes with revert-skip
semantics (`execTrace`).

Contents:

* **Exact-effect (frame) theorems** for every role-gated operation: a successful
  `pause`/`unpause`/`creditYield`/admin-op/oracle-op is shown to equal the
  pre-state with only its named non-asset fields overridden, so no balance, supply,
  reserve, or unlock-position field can move.
* **Balance-field forms** (T1-T3): the frame results instantiated on every balance
  and supply field, by exhaustive case analysis over the closed `Op` inductive —
  the same pattern as the requirement theorems in `Apyx.lean`.
* **Trace forms**: the frame results are lifted by induction to arbitrarily
  long attack traces (`execTrace`), giving the memo's headline shape
  `userLoss(execSeq s₀ σ) ≤ B(R, s₀)` with `B` read off the surviving fields.
* **Non-custodial theorems (T4)**: the single-step debit analyses
  (`no_role_transfers_user_funds`, `no_role_burns_user_shares`,
  `no_role_debits_usdc`), governance-token immutability, unlock-position seizure
  bounds, and the trace-level headline: even if **every** operator key is stolen,
  a user who signs nothing and is not targeted by an approved RFQ counterparty
  cannot lose a single unit of any balance.
* **Tier-2 stepping stones**: redemption-price provenance and the reserve-outflow
  law, the single-step characterizations behind T5/T6.

Everything here is additive: the ground-truth model and its 81 requirement theorems
in `D2fsSpecs/Apyx.lean` are untouched. Because that file's helper lemmas are
`private`, the small set of step-inversion lemmas needed here is re-derived locally
(named `inv_*`).

/-! ## Trace execution (revert-skip semantics)

An attack trace is a list of `(op, caller)` pairs executed in order. An operation
whose guard fails reverts and leaves the state unchanged — exactly like a reverted
transaction on chain — and the trace continues. -/

/-- Execute a list of `(op, caller)` pairs in order; failed operations revert
(leave the state unchanged) and the trace continues. -/
def execTrace (s : State) : List (Op × Address) → State
  | [] => s
  | (op, c) :: σ =>
    match step s op c with
    | some s' => execTrace s' σ
    | none => execTrace s σ

/-! ## Role-gated operation classes

Each predicate lists exactly the operations whose *authorization* is the given role.
The exact-effect theorems below show (a) each such operation indeed demands the role
(soundness of the classification) and (b) its complete state effect. Note that a
compromised role key can of course also submit non-role-gated operations from the
role address, but those are covered by the universal non-custodial theorems (T4),
which hold for arbitrary callers. -/

portion being folded into `fullyVestedAmount` never exceeds the pool it is drawn
from, so the `Nat`-subtraction is exact and the accrued value is conserved, not
lost. -/

/-! ## T2: `yield_distributor_cannot_extract`

Full compromise of the `yieldDistributor` key cannot extract assets: the only
operation the role authorizes is `creditYield`. `creditYield` is accrue-first (cf.
`Apyx.lean`'s `req_credit_preserves_accrued_vest`): it first realizes whatever has
already linearly streamed out of the current vest clock into `fullyVestedAmount`,
*then* folds the remainder alongside the newly credited `amount` into a
freshly-restarted `vestTotal`/`vestStart` clock. Because of this, `vestTotal` alone
is **not** monotone — a credit can shrink `vestTotal` (when the already-streamed
portion `newlyVestedAmount` exceeds `amount`) — but no value is ever lost: exactly
that streamed portion moves into `fullyVestedAmount` instead, so the combined pool
`fullyVestedAmount + vestTotal` always grows by exactly the credited `amount`.
`usdcReserve` increases unconditionally. No user balance, supply, or unlock
position is reachable.

Liveness caveat (documented, not a safety violation): because `creditYield` resets
`vestStart := now`, a compromised distributor can repeatedly credit `0` to postpone
the vesting of already-accrued yield indefinitely. The combined pool
(`fullyVestedAmount + vestTotal`) and the reserve never decrease, so no asset is
lost. -/

/-- Exact effect of `creditYield`: it demands the yieldDistributor role, adds the
amount to the USDC reserve, realizes the currently-streamed portion of the vest
into `fullyVestedAmount`, folds the remainder plus the new amount into a
freshly-restarted `vestTotal`, resets the vesting clock, and touches nothing
else. -/

**increase** — the role can pay in, never extract. (`vestTotal` alone is NOT
monotone in general — the accrue-first step can shrink it while growing

/-! ## T3: `admin_cannot_touch_balances`, frame and trace forms

Full compromise of the `admin` key reaches exactly nine fields — the two access
lists and seven pricing/schedule parameters — and no balance, supply, reserve, or
unlock-position field. Each of the eight admin-gated operations gets an
*exact-effect* lemma (the entire post-state is the pre-state with named fields
overridden), the frames are combined into the single-step balance statement
`admin_cannot_touch_balances`, and lifted to arbitrary-length admin-only traces.

Scope caveats (what a compromised admin CAN do, all deferred effects on future
operations rather than debits of recorded holdings):
* `removeFromWhitelist`/`addToDenylist` block a user's future deposits/redemptions
  (liveness attack; cf. T8 `timelock_escape_guarantee` — admin changes are
  immediate in this model, so there is no escape window);
* `handleStressEvent` + `catastrophicBackstop` rewrite `totalCollateralValue` and
  then set `redemptionValue := totalCollateralValue`, repricing all *future*
  redemptions (including RFQ redemptions executed against a user by a counterparty)
  — quantifying that channel is Tier 2's T6 `oracle_blast_radius`;
* `setYieldRate`/`setVestPeriod` distort future yield accrual timing. -/

/-- T3 `admin_cannot_touch_balances` (docs/05-blast-radius.md, Tier 1) — the
single-step balance-field form.

Threat model: the `admin` key is fully compromised. The operations gated on
`caller = s.admin` in `step` are exactly the eight of `AdminOp`: `addToWhitelist`,
`removeFromWhitelist`, `addToDenylist`, `removeFromDenylist`, `setYieldRate`,
`handleStressEvent`, `catastrophicBackstop`, and `setVestPeriod`.

Claim: none of these operations changes any balance or supply field — every apxUSD,
apyUSD, and USDC balance, both total supplies, the vault's apxUSD holdings, and the
USDC reserve are unchanged. A compromised admin cannot *directly* move or destroy a
single unit of anyone's funds.

Scope note (what is NOT claimed): the admin can still attack *future liveness and
economics* — denylisting/de-whitelisting blocks a user's future deposits and
redemptions, `setVestPeriod`/`setYieldRate` distort future yield accrual, and
`handleStressEvent`/`catastrophicBackstop` rewrite `totalCollateralValue`/
`redemptionValue`, changing the USDC value paid out by *future* redemptions. Those are
parameter attacks on future operations (Tier 2/Tier 3 territory, cf. T6/T8 in the
memo), not direct debits of recorded holdings — which is precisely the honest scope of
this theorem. -/

The oracle's two operations are `updateRedemptionValue` (a no-op placeholder in
this model — notably, `redemptionValue` is writable only through the admin's
`catastrophicBackstop`) and `setApxUSDMarketPrice`. Their *direct* blast radius is
exactly the reported market-price field; the security-relevant channel is indirect:
`apxUSDMarketPrice` gates the arbitrage mint pathway (`ray < apxUSDMarketPrice` in
`Op.mintApxUSD`), which still takes 1 USDC per apxUSD minted from the *minter*.
Quantifying worst-case extraction through mispricing is T6 (`oracle_blast_radius`,
Tier 2). -/

/-! ## T4: the non-custodial invariants and the trace headline

First the single-step non-custodial invariants for the three fungible balances
(apxUSD, apyUSD shares, external USDC) — by total case analysis over every
operation — then the two remaining asset classes (governance tokens, unlock
positions), and finally the trace-level statement that is the memo's headline. -/

/-- T4 `no_role_transfers_user_funds` (docs/05-blast-radius.md, Tier 1) — the
non-custodial invariant for apxUSD.

Threat model: ANY set of privileged keys (admin, oracle, pauseController,
yieldDistributor, governance — all of them at once) is compromised, e.g. the whole team
is phished. Can the attacker move an arbitrary user's apxUSD?

Claim: total case analysis over every operation shows that if any address `a`'s apxUSD
balance strictly decreased across a successful step, then either
* `a` was the caller of that very operation (the debit was self-initiated: `lockApxUSD`,
  `requestUnlock`, `flexibleRequestUnlock`, or `redeemApxUSD` spending the caller's own
  tokens), or
* the operation was `executeRFQRedemption a amount` — the single carve-out — in which
  case the caller was an approved RFQ counterparty and `a` was *simultaneously
  compensated in the same step* with the full redemption payout
  (`amount * redemptionValue / ray` USDC credited to `a`'s USDC balance).

No privileged role has any pathway to debit an arbitrary user's apxUSD: pause/unpause,
list management, rate/period setting, yield crediting, oracle updates, stress handling,
and the backstop all leave every apxUSD balance unchanged (they fall into the
contradiction branch of this proof).

Carve-out honesty: `executeRFQRedemption` genuinely debits a non-caller, so the naive
"only the caller can be debited" claim is FALSE of this model and is not what we prove.
The carve-out is a *swap*, not a theft — the debited user atomically receives the
corresponding USDC at the recorded `redemptionValue`. Note that a compromised admin can
first move `redemptionValue` via `catastrophicBackstop` (and RFQ counterparty onboarding
is not itself an `Op`, so `rfqCounterparties` is effectively static in-model); pricing
the worst case of that combination is exactly Tier 2's `oracle_blast_radius` (T6), not
this theorem. -/

/-- T4 headline (trace form) — total-compromise immunity for passive users.

Threat model: **every** privileged key at once — admin, oracle, pauseController,
yieldDistributor, governance, plus any number of ordinary accounts — is controlled
by the attacker, who runs an arbitrarily long trace of operations. The only
assumptions are that user `u` signs nothing in the trace (`u` is never a caller)
and that no approved RFQ counterparty executes an RFQ redemption *against `u`*
(that compensated-swap pathway is priced separately; cf.
`no_role_transfers_user_funds` and T6).

Claim: none of `u`'s four recorded holdings can decrease — apxUSD, apyUSD vault
shares, external USDC, and governance tokens (the last is bitwise unchanged). The
team being fully phished cannot move your balances. -/
@[formalMeta "Non-custodial guarantee"

/-! ## Toward Tier 2 (T5 `no_theft_ledger` / T6 `oracle_blast_radius`)

Two single-step characterizations that are the induction steps for the Tier-2
ledger arguments. They also settle the *attribution* question for T6 in this model:
the redemption price is not an oracle-controlled quantity at all — it is writable
exclusively by the admin's `catastrophicBackstop` (the model's `updateRedemptionValue`
is a placeholder no-op). The real-world analogue (Yearn's finding that Apyx's
`ApxUSDRateOracle.setRate` sits behind a 0-second timelock) therefore maps to the
*admin coalition* here: worst case, `handleStressEvent` drives
`totalCollateralValue` to 0 and `catastrophicBackstop` publishes
`redemptionValue = 0`, after which an approved RFQ counterparty can burn users'
apxUSD for zero USDC. Pricing that coalition is T10's table; the theorems below pin
down the only channels through which it can act. -/

/-- The redemption price is admin-gated: if a step changes `redemptionValue`, the
operation was `catastrophicBackstop`, the caller held the admin role, and the new
value is the recorded `totalCollateralValue`. In particular the oracle role has
**no** influence over the redemption price in this model. -/

/-! ## T5 `no_theft_ledger` — first-principles conservation for a passive bystander

The trace-level unification of T4: a fixed victim address `a` who **signs nothing**
(never a caller anywhere in `σ`) and is **never the user-argument of an
`executeRFQRedemption`** anywhere in `σ` cannot lose any of their transferable
holdings, no matter what operations — including every privileged-role operation, in
any order — the attacker interleaves around them. This is the memo's headline "even
if the whole team is phished, your balance can't be moved," stated over the whole
trace.

Ledger design (per Task 2): rather than adding a ledger field to `State` (which would
touch the ground-truth 81-theorem file), the ledger is a **module-local derived
function over the trace state** — `netHoldings`, the sum of an address's three
transferable balances. Conservation is then "`netHoldings` is non-decreasing across
the trace for the passive `a`", proved by combining the three per-field bounds. The
governance token is separately, absolutely immutable
(`governance_token_balances_immutable`), so it is not part of the mutable ledger. -/

for a passive bystander.

Threat model: **every** privileged key at once (admin, oracle, pauseController,
yieldDistributor, governance) plus any number of ordinary accounts is the attacker,
running an arbitrarily long trace `σ`. Two carve-outs, stated as hypotheses:
`h_never_signs` (`a` is never a caller in `σ`) and `h_never_rfq_target` (`a` is
never the user-argument of an `executeRFQRedemption` — the one compensated-swap
pathway that can debit a non-caller; a priced swap, not theft; pricing it is T6).

Claim: each of `a`'s three transferable balances is non-decreasing across the
entire trace, hence so is the derived ledger `netHoldings` — proved by lifting the
single-step non-custodial lemmas through the trace via
`user_assets_immune_to_total_key_compromise`. -/

/-! ## T6 `oracle_blast_radius` — what an oracle-key compromise can extract

Two honest results.

**(a)** The oracle key acting *alone* extracts exactly zero: a trace of only
`OracleOp`s (`updateRedemptionValue`/`setApxUSDMarketPrice`) moves no balance,
supply, or reserve — its entire footprint is the reported market-price parameter
`apxUSDMarketPrice`. (`oracle_alone_preserves_balances`, from the oracle trace frame.)

**(b)** The danger is a *coalition*, and the finding is that **the model places no
clamp on the redemption price**, so the USDC paid out on a single redeem is unbounded
above — there is no in-model invariant capping it. We prove this positively:

* `redeem_payout_formula`: a successful `redeemApxUSD amount` pays the caller exactly
  `amount * redemptionValue / ray` USDC out of the reserve;
* `redeem_payout_has_no_cap`: for **any** target `N`, there is a state and a
  *single-token* redeem whose payout is `≥ N`. The witness fixes `amount = 1` and
  scales `redemptionValue` to `N * ray`, so one apxUSD is redeemed for `N` USDC. No
  guard in `redeemApxUSD` (nor in the price writer `catastrophicBackstop`, which sets
  `redemptionValue := totalCollateralValue` with no upper bound — cf.
  `redemption_price_admin_only`) bounds `redemptionValue`, so no upper bound on payout
  is provable: the absence of a model-level cap, itself the key finding.

This is exactly the memo's T6 conclusion "in the current clamp-free model f =
usdcReserve (full drain)" and the real-world analogue of Yearn's finding that Apyx's
`ApxUSDRateOracle.setRate` sits behind a 0-second timelock. It motivates Tier 3's
rate-limit / clamp. Attribution note (`redemption_price_admin_only`): in *this* model
the redemption price is written by the admin's `catastrophicBackstop`, not the oracle
op, so the extraction coalition is admin (price) + redeemer/RFQ-counterparty (drain);
`updateRedemptionValue` is a placeholder no-op. -/

/-- T6(a) `oracle_alone_preserves_balances`: an arbitrarily long trace whose operations
are ALL oracle-gated leaves every balance, supply, and reserve field bitwise unchanged.
The oracle key acting alone extracts exactly zero — its only reachable field is the
reported market price `apxUSDMarketPrice` (`oracle_trace_blast_radius`), and the
redemption price in particular is untouched (`redemptionValue` unchanged). -/

/-- T6(b), the finding: **the single-redeem payout has no upper bound in the model.**

For any target `N`, there is a state and a single-token (`amount = 1`) redemption whose
USDC payout to the redeemer is at least `N`: the witness sets `redemptionValue = N * ray`
(everything else at defaults, whitelisted caller with one apxUSD and an `N`-unit
reserve), so one apxUSD redeems for `N` USDC. Because `redeemApxUSD` has **no guard**
bounding `redemptionValue`, and its only writer `catastrophicBackstop` sets it to the
unbounded `totalCollateralValue` (`redemption_price_admin_only`), there is no
in-model invariant capping the payout — no upper bound is provable, because none
exists. This is the honest T6 result: in the current clamp-free model the extractable
amount is limited only by the reserve, motivating a Tier-3 rate-limit / price clamp.

/-! ## Active no-extraction: every apxUSD credit is backed (caller-side dual of T5)

T5 (`no_theft_ledger`) bounds what a *passive* victim who never signs can lose:
nothing. This section is the **active** complement: an attacker who DOES sign — with
any keys, including every privileged role at once — cannot create apxUSD value from
nothing. Exhaustive case analysis over the closed `step` shows the model has **no
`step` case that mints apxUSD to an address without either an equal USDC payment
into the reserve or the settlement of that address's own pre-existing recorded
locked position** — no free-mint path exists for any caller. Cite together with T5:
passive users cannot lose (T5), active callers cannot gain unbacked value (this).

RFQ carve-out note: `executeRFQRedemption` never *credits* apxUSD (it burns the
user's apxUSD and pays USDC), so it does not appear in the credit disjunction at
all. Its USDC leg is priced at the admin-controlled `redemptionValue` with no cap
(`redeem_payout_has_no_cap`, T6) and is exactly the outflow channel tracked by
`reserve_outflow_only_via_redemption` — the unbounded coalition channel is USDC
*outflow* at a corrupted price, never apxUSD *creation*. -/

/-- Active no-extraction, single step: **every apxUSD credit is backed**.

Threat model: arbitrary caller (any compromised role, or any ordinary account).
If any address `a`'s apxUSD balance strictly increased across a successful step,
total case analysis over `step` shows the operation is one of exactly three backed
channels:

1. **Paid mint** — `depositUSDC amount` (with `a` the caller) or `mintApxUSD a amount`
   (the arbitrage mint to `a`): the credit is exactly `amount`, and in the *same
   atomic step* the **caller paid `amount` USDC** — the caller held at least `amount`
   USDC, their balance is debited by `amount`, and the reserve grows by `amount`.
   Strict 1:1 backing; no free value for anyone (for the arbitrage mint the payer is
   the caller, so a mint directed at a third party is a gift from the caller, not a
   mint from nothing).
2. **Standard claim** — `claimUnlock id` settling a recorded unlock position **owned
   by `a`** (`unlockRequests id = some (a, amount, _)` and
   `unlockTokenOwner id = some a`, cooldown elapsed): the credit is exactly the
   recorded `amount`, i.e. value `a` locked earlier via the apxUSD burns in
   `requestUnlock`/`withdraw`/`redeem`.
3. **Flexible claim** — `flexibleClaimUnlock id` settling `a`'s recorded flexible
   position: the credit is the recorded amount *minus* the early-exit fee, hence
   never exceeds the recorded amount.

No other case credits apxUSD: `lockApxUSD`, `requestUnlock`, `flexibleRequestUnlock`,
`redeemApxUSD`, and `executeRFQRedemption` only *burn* it, `withdraw`/`redeem` and
every role-gated operation leave every apxUSD balance unchanged (they land in the
contradiction branches of this proof).

This lemma is the induction step for the trace-level summed conservation
("`a`'s total apxUSD received across `execTrace` ≤ initial holdings + USDC paid in
+ own positions settled"); the summed form additionally needs a finite ledger of
`a`'s live unlock-position amounts (to price channels 2-3 at trace start) and is
left as the stated next step. -/

/-! ## T7 `rate_limit_linear_bound` — a per-epoch outflow cap makes damage linear in time

**DESIGN theorem** (docs/05-blast-radius.md, Tier 3): this section models the
defence mechanism itself — an ERC-7265-style circuit breaker that caps the USDC
reserve outflow charged per epoch — and proves what it would guarantee. The base
Apyx model has **no** such limiter (per the memo, and per T6's
`redeem_payout_has_no_cap` a single corrupted-price redemption can drain the whole
reserve), so this is a statement about the *value of adopting the mechanism*, not a
property of the current protocol.

The wrapper adds no field to `State`: a new structure `RLState` layers an epoch
counter, a per-epoch spent meter, and a fixed cap over the untouched base state, and
`step2` runs the unmodified base `step` behind an outflow gate. By
`reserve_outflow_only_via_redemption`, the only base transitions the gate ever
charges are the two redemption paths (`step2_charge_only_for_redemption` below) —
everything else passes through unmetered because it cannot decrease the reserve.

Headline: across an arbitrary `execTrace2` run containing `k` `advanceEpoch` clock
actions, the net reserve outflow is `≤ cap * (k + 1)` — **damage is at most linear
in elapsed epochs**, no matter how an attacker holding every key sequences
operations inside each epoch. -/

resets the meter and increments the epoch counter. -/

/-- T7 `rate_limit_linear_bound` (docs/05-blast-radius.md, Tier 3) — **the rate
limiter provably caps cumulative loss linearly in elapsed time**.

Threat model: the attacker holds **every** key and submits an arbitrary wrapper
trace `τ` — any base operations with any callers, interleaved with `advanceEpoch`
clock actions in any pattern (the clock is not attacker-favourable: more epochs only
means more elapsed time). The only assumption is the limiter's own invariant at the
start, `spentThisEpoch ≤ cap` (true of any freshly initialized wrapper, e.g.
`spentThisEpoch = 0`; it is self-maintaining, `step2_spent_le_cap`).

Claim: the net USDC reserve outflow over the whole run is at most
`cap * (countEpochs τ + 1)` — one budget for the current epoch plus one per epoch
boundary crossed, i.e. the memo's `userLoss(t) ≤ cap × ⌈t/epoch⌉`. Within any single
epoch the attacker can sequence redemptions however they like (including at an
admin-corrupted `redemptionValue`, cf. T6); the gate reverts anything past the cap,
so damage accumulates at most linearly with time — buying detection/response time,
which is exactly the design value of an ERC-7265-style circuit breaker.

DESIGN theorem: the base Apyx model contains no such limiter, and T6
(`redeem_payout_has_no_cap`) shows its unlimited counterpart; this theorem proves
what adding the limiter would buy. -/

/-! ## T8 `timelock_escape_guarantee` — Half 1: the base model has NO escape window

The memo's T8 asks for the escape-hatch guarantee "after a malicious privileged
change is queued, users have a `delay`-long window to exit before it lands." That
property cannot even be *stated* over the base Apyx model, because the base model
has no queue: every privileged operation takes effect **in the very step that
requests it**. The two theorems below characterize this absence precisely (this is
the honest negative result — the base model's timelock is zero seconds, exactly
Yearn's real-world finding about `ApxUSDRateOracle.setRate`); the wrapper in the
second half then *adds* the mechanism and proves what it buys. -/

/-- T8 Half 1, universal form: **privileged repricing is instantaneous in the base
model.** Whenever `catastrophicBackstop` (the sole writer of the redemption price,
`redemption_price_admin_only`) succeeds, the new price is already in force in the
post-state of that same step, and the clock has not advanced by even one unit
(`s'.now = s.now`). There is no pending interval — no state in which the change is
"announced but not yet effective" — during which a user could still redeem at the
old price. Direct projection of `step_catastrophicBackstop_exact`. -/
theorem catastrophicBackstop_is_instantaneous (s : State) (caller : Address) (s' : State)
    (h : step s Op.catastrophicBackstop caller = some s') :
    caller = s.admin ∧ s'.now = s.now ∧
    s'.redemptionValue = s.totalCollateralValue := by
  obtain ⟨hc, rfl⟩ := step_catastrophicBackstop_exact s caller s' h
  exact ⟨hc, rfl, rfl⟩

/-- T8 Half 1, witness form: `base_model_has_no_timelock`. There is a state in which
the admin's `catastrophicBackstop` succeeds, **actually changes** the redemption
price, and does so at an unchanged clock (`s'.now = s.now`) — zero elapsed time
between the request and the effect. Together with the universal form above this
shows the base model provably has no timelock on privileged repricing: the escape
window has length exactly 0. NOT a vacuous claim about an unreachable guard — the
witness step succeeds and the price moves. (Why this matters: the exit guarantee of
Half 2 is a property of the *queue mechanism*, so it must be proved of a wrapper;
any attempt to prove it of the base model is falsified by this witness.) -/

/-! ## T8 Half 2 — a timelock wrapper DOES give the escape guarantee (DESIGN theorem)

**DESIGN theorem** (like T7): this section models the defence mechanism itself — a
timelock queue for privileged operations — and proves the guarantee it would
provide. The base Apyx model has no such queue (Half 1 above), so everything here
is a statement about the *value of adopting the mechanism*, not a property of the
current protocol.

The wrapper adds no field to `State` (mirroring T7's `RLState`): `TLState` layers a
wrapper clock, a pending queue, and a fixed `delay` policy parameter over the
untouched base state. Privileged operations enter through `queue`, which only
*records* `(op, caller, tl.now)` — the base state is untouched, so users can still
transact (in particular exit) against the old parameters. `tick` advances the
wrapper clock by one. `execute i` runs the stored base operation via the unmodified
base `step`, and **reverts unless the entry's queue timestamp is at least `delay`
old** (`t₀ + delay ≤ now`).

Headline (`timelock_escape_guarantee`): if an operation queued at the current
instant is later executed — after any further wrapper trace `τ` the attacker
likes — then `τ` contains at least `delay` `tick` actions. Since the wrapper clock
moves only via `tick` (`execTraceTL_now`), this is exactly "a guaranteed
`delay`-tick-long window elapses between the announcement and the effect," the
escape hatch of Eyal & Sirer / the memo's T8. -/

/-- Timelocked wrapper state: the untouched base `State`, a wrapper clock, the
queue of pending privileged operations — each entry `(op, caller, queuedAt)`
records the wrapper time at which it was queued — and the fixed timelock length
`delay` (a policy parameter; `step2tl` never changes it). -/

its timelock has fully elapsed (`queuedAt + delay ≤ now`), in which case it runs
the unmodified base `step` and removes the entry. -/

/-- T8 `timelock_escape_guarantee` (docs/05-blast-radius.md, Tier 3) — **the
timelock wrapper provably guarantees a `delay`-long exit window.**

DESIGN theorem: the base Apyx model has no timelock (`base_model_has_no_timelock`
— privileged repricing is instantaneous); this theorem proves what adding the
queue mechanism would buy.

Threat model: the attacker holds every key. At some reachable wrapper state `tl`
they `queue` a privileged base operation `op` (e.g. `catastrophicBackstop`,
stamped with the current wrapper time `tl.now`), then submit **any** further
wrapper trace `τ` — more queues, ticks, and executes in any pattern — after which
an `execute` that consumes an entry carrying that stamp succeeds.

Claim: `τ` contains at least `delay` `tick` actions. Since the wrapper clock
advances only via `tick` (`execTraceTL_now`) and `queue` leaves the base state
bitwise untouched (`step2tl_queue_exact`), a full `delay` units of wrapper time
provably separate the public announcement of the change from the earliest instant
it can take effect — and throughout that window the queued operation has
contributed nothing to the base state (`tl_base_changes_only_via_execute`), so
users can still exit against the pre-change parameters. This is the memo's
"escape hatch" guarantee; contrast Half 1, where the window has length 0. -/

  balances, both supplies, the vault's apxUSD, i.e. everything users own or that
  backs what they own — bitwise unchanged, the reserve can only move **upward**
  (the role pays in, never out), and the combined vest pool
  `fullyVestedAmount + vestTotal` can only move **upward** too (`vestTotal` alone
  is NOT monotone — an accrue-first credit can shrink it while growing
  `fullyVestedAmount` by the same amount, cf. T2's `yield_distributor_frame`). A
  distributor compromise can distort *future yield accrual timing*, never
  principal.
* The pauser compartment is the **`globalPause` liveness bit alone**: an all-pauser
  trace leaves every principal field *and* every pricing parameter unchanged. A
  pauser compromise is a freeze, never a loss. -/

/-! ## T10 `coalition_bound` — quantifying the worst coalition (base-model theorems)

The headline finding. Two results contrasting single-key impotence with a specific
two-key coalition that drains a victim's principal:

* `single_key_bounds`: a corollary **table** — for any victim `u`, over any
  single-role attack trace, **no single key extracts principal**. Oracle-alone,
  pauser-alone, and admin-alone leave every user balance *and* the reserve bitwise
  unchanged; distributor-alone leaves user balances unchanged and can only *grow*
  the reserve (it pays in). Each row is a projection of the corresponding Tier-1/2
  trace theorem.
* `admin_rfq_coalition_drains`: the **quantitative coalition** result. The
  `{admin, approved-RFQ-counterparty}` pair drains a victim's entire apxUSD for
  zero USDC — the admin publishes `redemptionValue = 0` via `catastrophicBackstop`
  (dropping it from a healthy `ray`), after which the counterparty's
  `executeRFQRedemption` burns all of the victim's apxUSD and credits exactly
  `amount * 0 / ray = 0` USDC. Net loss = 100% of holdings, in stark contrast to
  the single-key rows.

Headline conclusion (see the docstrings): the security of user funds against a
compromised admin rests **entirely** on the RFQ counterparty set and on the absence
of a rate limit / redemption-price floor — exactly the mechanisms T7 (rate limit)
and T8 (timelock) add. In the current model neither exists, so the coalition drain
is unbounded (cf. T6 `redeem_payout_has_no_cap`). -/

/-- The RFQ redemption's exact effect on the targeted user, unconditionally: a
successful `executeRFQRedemption user amount` burns `amount` of the user's apxUSD

compromised key extracts principal.**

For an arbitrary victim `u` and four independent attack traces, each consisting
solely of one role's operations:

* **oracle alone** (`oracle_alone_preserves_balances`): every apxUSD balance and the
  USDC reserve are bitwise unchanged — extraction 0;
* **pauser alone** (`pauser_compartmentalized`): likewise unchanged — extraction 0;
* **distributor alone** (`distributor_compartmentalized`): user apxUSD balances
  unchanged and the reserve only *grows* — the role pays in, extraction 0;
* **admin alone** (`admin_trace_blast_radius`): balances and reserve untouched —
  extraction 0 (the admin's power is over *future* pricing/liveness, not recorded
  holdings; cf. `admin_cannot_touch_balances`).

The contrast with `admin_rfq_coalition_drains` (two keys ⇒ 100% loss) is the value

/-- T10 `admin_rfq_coalition_drains` (docs/05-blast-radius.md, Tier 3) — **the worst
coalition, quantified: `{admin, RFQ-counterparty}` inflicts 100% loss.**

Threat model: the admin key and one approved RFQ-counterparty key are both
compromised. The victim (address `0`) holds 100 apxUSD, no USDC, and the redemption
price starts healthy at `ray` (= $1.00 — the victim could redeem 100 apxUSD for 100
USDC).

The coalition acts in two steps:
1. the **admin** calls `catastrophicBackstop`, which publishes
   `redemptionValue := totalCollateralValue = 0` (`redemption_price_admin_only`;
   the price crashes from `ray` to 0 with no floor and no delay — cf. T8's
   `base_model_has_no_timelock`);
2. the approved **RFQ counterparty** calls `executeRFQRedemption victim 100`, which
   burns all 100 of the victim's apxUSD and credits them `100 * 0 / ray = 0` USDC
   (`rfq_payout_formula`).

Outcome (proved on the concrete witness): the victim's apxUSD goes 100 → 0 while
their USDC stays 0 — a **total, uncompensated loss of principal**. Contrast every
row of `single_key_bounds`, where each key alone extracts 0. This is the memo's
headline: user-fund security against a compromised admin rests entirely on the RFQ
counterparty set and on the missing rate-limit / price-floor (T7/T8). -/
