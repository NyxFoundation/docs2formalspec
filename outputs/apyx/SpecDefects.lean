/-! # Spec-consistency search (`docs/07-spec-defects.md`)

Results of the "fourth activity" of §`docs/07`: turning the lens on the RFC 2119 requirement
set itself and asking whether it is internally consistent, rather than proving `model ⊨
requirement` (which treats the spec as ground truth and can never find it *wrong*). Each
candidate from `docs/07` §3 is triaged against the **source documentation** (`corpus.md`,
implementation): a candidate confirmed as a genuine *source* defect stays here as a defect
witness; a candidate traced to an *extraction* artifact (D6 — the LLM dropping a scope/exception
present in the source) is **fixed at the source** (`requirements.json`/`SPEC.md`) and its theorem
kept as the conformance property it actually demonstrates.

**Candidate 1 — resolved as an extraction defect, source now fixed.** The apparent
`buffer-non-decreasing` vs `catastrophic-backstop` contradiction was traced to `corpus.md`,
which is consistent: it scopes buffer preservation to *routine redemptions* and *stress events*
and treats the catastrophic backstop (a terminal hack/wind-down) as a separate mechanism that
distributes the buffer. The extractor had over-generalized `buffer-non-decreasing` into an
unconditional "MUST NOT decrease". `requirements.json`/`SPEC.md` have been corrected to restore
the routine/stress scope with the explicit catastrophic exception, and the model's
`req_buffer_non_decreasing` (already scoped to routine ops) now matches. The theorem below is
retained as the machine-checked statement of that catastrophic *exception*: the mandated
backstop step distributes the entire buffer (drives it to zero), which is exactly what
`catastrophic-backstop` requires and what the corrected `buffer-non-decreasing` now excludes.

This module is additive and leaves `Apyx.lean`/`BlastRadius.lean`/`Safety.lean` untouched. -/

namespace Apyx

/-- Witness state for the buffer/backstop contradiction: a positive overcollateralization
buffer, with `totalSupply_apxUSD = ray` so that the redemption total equals the redemption
value. Everything else is at defaults; the buffer is `totalCollateralValue - redemptionTotal
= 1 - 0 = 1`. -/
private def bufWitness : State :=
  { (default : State) with
      totalSupply_apxUSD := ray, totalCollateralValue := 1, redemptionValue := 0 }

/-- The post-state of the mandated `catastrophicBackstop` step on `bufWitness`: exactly the
model's per-unit effect (`redemptionValue := totalCollateralValue * ray / totalSupply_apxUSD`,
`emergencyFlag := true`). On `bufWitness` (TCV = 1, supply = ray) this evaluates to `1`. -/
private def bufWitness' : State :=
  { bufWitness with
      redemptionValue := bufWitness.totalCollateralValue * ray / bufWitness.totalSupply_apxUSD,
      emergencyFlag := true }

/-- **`req_catastrophic_backstop_distributes_buffer`** (docs/07 candidate 1, resolved): the
machine-checked *catastrophic exception* to buffer preservation. On a catastrophic backstop the
mandated step distributes the entire overcollateralization buffer — driving it to zero — which
is what `catastrophic-backstop` requires and what the corrected `buffer-non-decreasing`
(scoped to routine redemptions and stress events) explicitly excludes.

The witness exhibits a state with a strictly positive buffer on which the admin-authorized
`catastrophicBackstop` step, whose own postcondition `redemptionValue = totalCollateralValue`
holds on the result, *strictly decreases* the buffer. This originally surfaced as an apparent
requirement contradiction; tracing it to `corpus.md` showed the source is consistent and the
fault was an over-generalized extraction of `buffer-non-decreasing` (now corrected in
`requirements.json`/`SPEC.md`). The theorem is retained as the positive statement of the
exception, and it partially closes the "second clause of catastrophic-backstop not modeled"
gap noted in `README` §6.2 — the buffer-distribution effect (buffer → 0) is now proved, though
the per-holder pro-rata split remains outside the aggregate ledger's expressible scope. -/
